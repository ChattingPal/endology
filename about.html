          <br>
          Endology is a religion, also referred to as an Occult. We believe 
          in the supernatural and the spiritual. It is important to note that 
          a cult and an occult are not the same. A cult typically refers to a 
          group with extreme or unorthodox beliefs, often led by a charismatic 
          leader, whereas an occult involves the study and practice of mystical, 
          supernatural, or magical phenomena.</p>
