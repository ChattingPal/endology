          <p style="width: 700px; padding: 20px;"><strong>Endology follows a single, concise book, and here’s why: </strong>
          At Endology, we believe that the focus should not be solely on the book itself, but on the reasons behind its creation.
          We recognize the existence of two realms: the living and the dead. The dead realm is inhabited by souls without bodies,
          while the living realm is where we reside. The dead realm attempts to communicate with us through ghosts, who are caught 
          in Limbo, unable to fully transition to either realm. Through Endology, you can connect with professionals who facilitate 
          communication with the dead via these spirits, allowing you to reach out to your lost loved ones.</p>

          <p style="width: 700px; padding: 20px;"><strong>END SCIENTOLOGY ACT - Performed by Endology</strong>
          <br>
          Endology, the name might seem very close to Scientology, but we infact are not like them. No because, Endology supports
          freedom and free choice, thereby the Cult Scientology is against our likings. We are actively trying to shut down
          Scientology for the best of humanity. Many victims fall into the traps of Scientology, and some might never seem to 
          leave, as Scientology is brainwashing their members into thinking, giving money to the cult saves them from aliens, and 
          that we do not like.</p>
